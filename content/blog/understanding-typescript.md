TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript adds optional static typing and class-based object-oriented programming to the language. It helps catch errors early through a type system and makes JavaScript development more efficient.

## Key Features

- **Type Safety**: Catch errors at compile time rather than runtime
- **Better IDE Support**: Enhanced autocompletion, navigation, and refactoring
- **Modern JavaScript Features**: Use the latest ECMAScript features
- **Gradual Adoption**: Adopt TypeScript incrementally in existing projects

## Getting Started

To get started with TypeScript, you can install it via npm:

```bash
npm install typescript --save-dev
```

Then create a `tsconfig.json` file to configure your TypeScript project.
